He is informed of the track which his companions intend to\n                  pursue, and if he is unable to follow, or overtake them, he perishes\n                  alone in the Desart; unless he should have the good fortune to fall in with\n                  some other Tribes of Indians. It is unnecessary to add that the females are equally, or still more, exposed to the same fate.

In the high Northern Lati- tudes,\n                  as the same writer informs us, when the Northern Lights vary their position\n                  in the air, they make a rustling and a crackling noise.

In youth by science nursed 13 And led by nature\n                  into a wild scene 14 Of lofty hopes, he to the world went forth, 15 A favored being, knowing no\n                  desire 16 Which genius did not hallow, 'gainst the taint 17 Of dissolute\n                  tongues, and jealousy, and hate 18 And scorn, against all enemies prepared, 19 All but neglect.\n                  The world, for so it thought, 20 Owed him no service : he was like a plant 21 Fair to the sun,\n                  the darling of the winds, 22 But hung with fruit which no one, that passed by, 23 Regarded, and, his\n                  spirit damped at once, 24 With indignation did he turn away 25 And with the food of pride\n                  sustained his soul 26 In solitude.—Stranger! these gloomy boughs 27 Had charms for him; and here\n                  he loved to sit, 28 His only visitants a straggling sheep, 29 The stone-chat, or the\n                  glancing sand-piper ; 30 And on these barren rocks, with juniper, 31 And heath, and\n                  thistle, thinly sprinkled o'er, 32 23 Fixing his downcast eye, he many an hour 33 A morbid pleasure\n                  nourished, tracing here 34 An emblem of his own unfruitful life : 35 And lifting up his\n                  head, he then would gaze 36 On the more distant scene; how lovely 'tis 37 Thou seest, and he\n                  would gaze till it became 38 Far lovelier, and his heart could not sustain 39 The beauty still\n                  more beauteous. Nor, that time 40 When Nature had subdued him to herself 41 Would he forget\n                  those beings, to whose minds, 42 Warm from the labours of benevolence, 43 The world, and man\n                  himself, appeared a scene 44 Of kindred loveliness : then he would sigh 45 With mournful joy,\n                  to think that others felt 46 What he must never feel : and so, lost man! 47 On visionary views\n                  would fancy feed, 48 Till his eye streamed with tears. In this deep vale 49 He died, this seat\n                  his only monument. 50"

You know that huge round beam 7 Which props the hanging\n                     wall of the old chapel? 8 26 Beneath that tree, while yet it was a tree 9 He found a baby wrapt in\n                     mosses, lined 10 With thistle beards, and such small locks of wool 11 As hang on\n                     brambles. Well, he brought him home, 12 And reared him at the then\n                     Lord Velez' cost. 13 And so the babe grew up a pretty boy, 14 A pretty boy,\n                     but most unteachable— 15 And never learnt a prayer, nor told a bead, 16 But knew the\n                     names of birds, and mocked their notes, 17 And whistled, as he were a\n                     bird himself : 18 And all the autumn 'twas his only play 19 To get the seeds of wild\n                     flowers, and to plant them 20 With earth and water, on the stumps of\n                     trees. 21 A Friar, who gathered simples in the wood, 22 A grey-haired\n                     man—he loved this little boy, 23 The boy loved him—and, when the Friar taught\n                     him, 24 He soon could write with the pen : and from that\n                     time, 25 Lived chiefly at the Convent or the Castle. 26 So he became a\n                     very learned youth. 27 But Oh! poor wretch!—he read, and read, and\n                     read, 28 'Till his brain turned—and ere his twentieth year, 29 27 He had unlawful thoughts of many things : 30 And though he\n                     prayed, he never loved to pray 31 With holy men, nor in a holy place— 32 But yet his\n                     speech, it was so soft and sweet, 33 The late Lord Velez ne'er was\n                     wearied with him. 34 And once, as by the north side of the Chapel 35 They stood\n                     together, chained in deep discourse, 36 The earth heaved under them\n                     with such a groan, 37 That the wall tottered, and had well-nigh fallen 38 Right on their heads. My Lord was sorely frightened; 39 A fever seized him, and he\n                     made confession 40 Of all the heretical and lawless talk 41 Which brought this\n                     judgment: so the youth was seized 42 And cast into that cell. My husband's father 43 Sobbed like a child—it almost broke his heart : 44 And once as he was working\n                     in the cellar, 45 He heard a voice distinctly; 'twas the youth's 46 Who sang a\n                     doleful song about green fields, 47 How sweet it were on lake or wild\n                     savannah, 48 To hunt for food, and be a naked man, 49 And wander up and down at\n                     liberty. 50 28 Leoni doted on the youth, and now 51 His love grew desperate ; and defying death, 52 He made that cunning\n                     entrance I described: 53 And the young man escaped. 54"

And so I dare to hope 66 Though changed, no\n                  doubt, from what I was, when first 67 205 I came among these hills ; when like a roe 68 I bounded o'er the\n                  mountains, by the sides 69 Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams, 70 Wherever nature\n                  led : more like a man 71 Flying from something that he dreads, than one 72 Who sought the\n                  thing he loved. For nature then 73 (The coarser pleasures of my boyish days, 74 And their glad\n                  animal movements all gone by,) 75 To me was all in all.—I cannot paint 76 What then I was.\n                  The sounding cataract 77 Haunted me like a passion : the tall rock, 78 The mountain, and\n                  the deep and gloomy wood, 79 Their colours and their forms, were then to me 80 An appetite : a\n                  feeling and a love, 81 That had no need of a remoter charm, 82 By thought supplied, or any\n                  interest 83 Unborrowed from the eye.—That time is past, 84 And all its aching joys are\n                  now no more, 85 And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this 86 206 Faint I, nor\n                  mourn nor murmur : other gifts 87 Have followed, for such loss, I would\n                  believe, 88 Abundant recompence. For I have learned 89 To look on nature, not as in\n                  the hour 90 Of thoughtless youth, but hearing oftentimes 91 The still, sad music of\n                  humanity, 92 Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power 93 To chasten and subdue. And I\n                  have felt 94 A presence that disturbs me with the joy 95 Of elevated thoughts ; a\n                  sense sublime 96 Of something far more deeply interfused, 97 Whose dwelling is the light\n                  of setting suns, 98 And the round ocean, and the living air, 99 And the blue sky, and in the\n                  mind of man, 100 A motion and a spirit, that impels 101 All thinking things, all\n                  objects of all thought, 102 And rolls through all things. Therefore am I\n                  still 103 A lover of the meadows and the woods, 104 And mountains ; and of all that\n                  we behold 105 207 From this green earth ; of all the mighty world 106 Of eye and ear, both what\n                  they half create,* 107 And what perceive ; well pleased to recognize 108 In nature and the\n                  language of the sense, 109 The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse, 110 The guide, the\n                  guardian of my heart, and soul 111 Of all my moral being. 112"

Nor perchance, 147 If I should be,\n                  where I no more can hear 148 Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these\n                  gleams 149 Of past existence, wilt thou then forget 150 That on the banks of this\n                  delightful stream 151 We stood together ; and that I, so long 152 A worshipper of Nature,\n                  hither came, 153 Unwearied in that service : rather say 154 With warmer love, oh ! with\n                  far deeper zeal 155 Of holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget, 156 210 That after many\n                  wanderings, many years 157 Of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs, 158 And this green\n                  pastoral landscape, were to me 159 More dear, both for themselves, and for thy\n                  sake. 160"

The Reader will perhaps have a general notion of it, if he has ever known a man, a Cap- tain of a small\n               trading vessel for example, who being past the middle age of life, had retired\n               upon an annuity or small independent income to some village or country town of which he was not a native, or in which he had not been accustomed to\n               live. Such men having little to do become credulous and talkative from\n               indolence ; and from the same cause, and other predisposing causes by which it\n               is probable that such men may have been affected, they are prone to\n               superstition. On which account it appeared to me proper to select a character\n               like this to exhibit some of the general laws by which superstition acts upon\n               the mind. Superstitious men are almost always men of slow faculties and\n               deep feelings; their minds are not loose but adhesive ; they have a reasonable\n               share of imagination, by which word I mean the faculty which produces\n               impressive NOTES. effects out of simple elements ; but they are utterly\n               desti- tute of fancy, the power by which pleasure and surprize are excited\n               by sudden varieties of situation and by accumu- lated imagery."

I\n               had two objects to attain ; first, to represent a picture which should not be unimpressive yet consistent with the character that should describe it,\n               secondly, while I adhered to the style in which such persons describe, to take\n               care that words, which in their minds are impregnated with passion, should\n               likewise convey passion to Readers who are not accustomed to sympathize\n               with men feeling in that manner or using such language. It seemed to me that\n               this might be done by calling in the assistance of Lyrical and rapid Metre. It was necessary that the Poem, to be natural, should in reality move slowly\n               ; yet I hoped, that, by the aid of the metre, to those who should at all enter\n               into the spirit of the Poem, it would appear to move quickly. The Reader will have the kindness to excuse this note as I am sensible that an\n               introductory Poem is necessary to give this Poem its full effect."

        "text": "Upon this occasion I will request permission to add a few words\n               closely connected with T he T horn and many other NOTES. Poems in these Volumes. There is a numerous class of readers who imagine that the same words cannot be repeated without\n               tautology : this is a great error : virtual tautology is much oftener produced\n               by using different words when the meaning is exactly the same. Words, a Poet's\n               words more particularly, ought to be weighed in the balance of feeling\n               and not measured by the space which they occupy upon paper. For the Reader\n               cannot be too often re- minded that Poetry is passion : it is the history or\n               science of feelings : now every man must know that an attempt is rarely\n               made to communicate impassioned feelings without something of an accompanying\n               consciousness of the inade- quateness of our own powers, or the deficiencies of\n               lan- guage. During such efforts there will be a craving in the mind, and\n               as long as it is unsatisfied the Speaker will cling to the same words, or words\n               of the same character. There are also various other reasons why repetition and\n               apparent tautology are frequently beauties of the highest kind. Among the\n               chief of these reasons is the interest which the mind at- taches to words, not\n               only as symbols of the passion, but as things , active and efficient,\n               which are of themselves part of the passion. And further, from a spirit of\n               fond- ness, exultation, and gratitude, the mind luxuriates in the\n               repetition of words which appear successfully to com- municate its feelings. The\n               truth of these remarks might be shewn by innumerable passages from the Bible\n               and from the impassioned poetry of every nation."

This wish had arisen from a\n               consciousness of the defects of the Poem, and from a knowledge that many\n               persons had been much displeased with it. The Poem of my Friend has\n               indeed great defects ; first, that the principal person has no distinct\n               character, either in his profession of Mari- ner, or as a human being who having\n               been long under the controul of supernatural impressions might be supposed himself to partake of something supernatural : secondly, that he does not\n               act, but is continually acted upon : thirdly, that the events having no\n               necessary connection do not produce each other ; and lastly, that the imagery\n               is some- what too laboriously accumulated. Yet the Poem contains many\n               delicate touches of passion, and indeed the passion NOTES. is every where true to\n               nature ; a great number of the stan- zas present beautiful images, and are\n               expressed with unu- sual felicity of language ; and the versification, though\n               the metre is itself unfit for long poems, is harmonious and artfully\n               varied, exhibiting the utmost powers of that metre, and every variety of which\n               it is capable. It therefore appeared to me that these several merits (the first\n               of which, namely that of the passion, is of the highest kind,) gave to the Poem a value which is not often possessed by better Poems. On this\n               account I requested of my Friend to per- mit me to republish it."
