         <header><br /><br /><br />PREFACE.</header>
         <p>The first Volume of these Poems has already <br />been submitted to general perusal. It
            was <br />published, as an experiment which, I hoped, <br />might be of some use to
            ascertain, how far, <br />by fitting to metrical arrangement a selection <br />of the
            real language of men in a state of vivid <br />sensation, that sort of pleasure and that
            quantity <br />of pleasure may be imparted, which a Poet may <br />rationally endeavour
            to impart.</p>
         <p>I had formed no very inaccurate estimate of the <br />probable effect of those Poems: I
            flattered myself </p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0010"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">vi.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>that they who should be pleased with them would <br />read them with more than common
            pleasure : and <br />on the other hand I was well aware that by those <br />who should
            dislike them they would be read with <br />more than common dislike. The result has
            <br />differed from my expectation in this only, that I <br />have pleased a greater
            number, than I ventured <br />to hope I should please.<br /></p>
         <p>For the sake of variety and from a consciousness <br />of my own weakness I was induced
            to request <br />the assistance of a Friend, who furnished me <br />with the Poems of
            the A<span class="small caps">ncient</span> M<span class="smcaps">ariner</span>, the
               <br />F<span class="small caps">oster</span>-M<span class="small caps">other's</span>
               T<span class="small caps">ale</span>, the N<span class="small caps"
            >ightingale</span>, <br />the D<span class="small caps">ungeon</span>, and the Poem
            entitled L<span class="small caps">ove</span>. <br />I should not, however, have
            requested this <br />assistance, had I not believed that the poems <br />of my Friend
            would in a great measure <br />have the same tendency as my own, and that,</p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0011"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">vii</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>though there would be found a difference, there <br />would be found no discordance in
            the colours of <br />our style; as our opinions on the subject of poetry <br />do almost
            entirely coincide.</p>
         <p>Several of my Friends are anxious for the success <br />of these Poems from a belief,
            that if the views, <br />with which they were composed, were indeed <br />realized, a
            class of Poetry would be produced, <br />well adapted to interest mankind permanently,
            <br />and not unimportant in the multiplicity and in the <br />quality of its moral
            relations : and on this account <br />they have advised me to prefix a systematic
            defence <br />of the theory, upon which the poems were written. <br />But I was
            unwilling to undertake the task, because <br />I knew that on this occasion the Reader
            would <br />look coldly upon my arguments, since I might <br />be suspected of having
            been principally influenced <br />by the selfish and foolish hope of <em>reasoning</em>
            him <br />into an approbation of these particular Poems :</p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0012"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">viii</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>and I was still more unwilling to undertake the <br />task, because adequately to
            display my opinions <br />and fully to enforce my arguments would require <br />a space
            wholly disproportionate to the nature of a <br />preface. For to treat the subject with
            the clear-<br />ness and coherence, of which I believe it ſuſcepti-<br />ble, it would
            be necessary to give a full account <br />of the present state of the public taste in
            this <br />country, and to determine how far this taste is <br />healthy or depraved;
            which again could not be <br />determined, without pointing out, in what man-<br />ner
            language and the human mind act and react <br />on each other, and without retracing the
            revolu-<br />tions not of literature alone but likewise of society <br />itself. I have
            therefore altogether declined to <br />enter regularly upon this defence ; yet I am
            sensi-<br />ble, that there would be some impropriety in <br />abruptly obtruding upon
            the Public, without a <br />few words of introduction, Poems so materially
            <br />different from those, upon which general appro-<br />bation is at present
            bestowed.</p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0013"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xi</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>It is supposed, that by the act of writing in verse <br />an Author makes a formal
            engagement that he <br />will gratify certain known habits of association, <br />that he
            not only thus apprizes the Reader that <br />certain classes of ideas and expressions
            will be <br />found in his book, but that others will be care-<br />fully excluded. This
            exponent or symbol held <br />forth by metrical language must in different æras <br />of
            literature have excited very different expecta-<br />tions : for example, in the age of
            Catullus Terence <br />and Lucretia, and that of Statius or Claudian, <br />and in our
            own country, in the age of Shakespeare <br />and Beaumont and Fletcher, and that of
            Donne <br />and Cowley, or Dryden, or Pope. I will not <br />take upon me to determine
            the exact import of <br />the promise which by the act of writing in verse <br />an
            Author in the present day makes to his Reader; <br />but I am certain it will appear to
            many persons <br />that I have not fulfilled the terms of an engage-<br />ment thus
            voluntarily contracted. I hope there- </p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0014"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">x</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>fore the Reader will not censure me, if I attempt <br />to state what I have proposed to
            myself to perform, <br />and also, (as far as the limits of a preface will <br />permit)
            to explain some of the chief reasons which <br />have determined me in the choice of my
            purpose : <br />that at least he may be spared any unpleasant <br />feeling of
            disappointment, and that I myself may <br />be protected from the most dishonorable
            accusa-<br />tion which can be brought against an Author, <br />namely, that of an
            indolence which prevents him <br />from endeavouring to ascertain what is his duty,
            <br />or, when his duty is ascertained prevents him <br />from performing it.</p>
         <p>The principal object then which I proposed to <br />myself in these Poems was to make
            the incidents <br />of common life interesting by tracing in them, <br />truly though
            not ostentatiously, the primary laws <br />of our nature : chiefly as far as regards the
            man-<br />ner in which we associate ideas in a state of </p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0015"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xi</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>excitement. Low and rustic life was generally <br />chosen because in that situation the
            essential <br />passions of the heart find a better soil in which <br />they can attain
            their maturity, are less under <br />restraint, and speak a plainer and more emphatic
            <br />language ; because in that situation our elementary <br />feelings exist in a
            state of greater simplicity and <br />consequently may be more accurately
            contempla-<br />ted and more forcibly communicated ; because <br />the manners of rural
            life germinate from those <br />elementary feelings; and from the necessary
            <br />character of rural occupations are more easily <br />comprehended ; and are more
            durable ; and lastly, <br />because in that situation the passions of men are
            <br />incorporated with the beautiful and permanent <br />forms of nature. The language
            too of these men <br />is adopted (purified indeed from what appear to <br />be its real
            defects, from all lasting and rational <br />causes of dislike or disgust) because such
            men <br />hourly communicate with the best objects from </p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0016"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xii</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>which the best part of language is originally <br />derived ; and because, from their
            rank in society <br />and the sameness and narrow circle of their inter-<br />course,
            being less under the action of social vanity <br />they convey their feelings and
            notions in simple <br />and unelaborated expressions. Accordingly such <br />a language
            arising out of repeated experience and <br />regular feelings is a more permanent and a
            far <br />more philosophical language than that which is <br />frequently substituted
            for it by Poets, who think <br />that they are conferring honour upon themselves
            <br />and their art in proportion as they separate them-<br />selves from the sympathies
            of men, and indulge <br />in arbitrary and capricious habits of expression in
            <br />order to furnish food for fickle tastes and fickle <br />appetites of their own
               creation.*<span class="footnote">* It is worth while here to observe that the
               affecting parts <br />of Chaucer are almost always expressed in language pure
               <br />and universally intelligible even to this day.</span></p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0017"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xiii</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>I cannot be insensible of the present outcry <br />against the triviality and meanness
            both of thought <br />and language, which some of my contemporaries <br />have
            occasionally introduced into their metrical <br />compositions; and I acknowledge that
            this defect <br />where it exists, is more dishonorable to the Wri-<br />ter's own
            character than false refinement or arbi-<br />trary innovation, though I should contend
            at the <br />same time that it is far less pernicious in the sum <br />of its
            consequences. From such verses the Poems <br />in these volumes will be found
            distinguished at <br />least by one mark of difference, that each of them <br />has a
            worthy <em>purpose</em>. Not that I mean to say, <br />that I always began to write with
            a distinct pur-<br />pose formally conceived ; but I believe that my <br />habits of
            meditation have so formed my feelings, <br />as that my descriptions of such objects as
            strongly <br />excite those feelings, will be found to carry along <br />with them a
               <em>purpose</em>. If in this opinion I am <br />mistaken I can have little right to
            the name of a</p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0018"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xiv</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>Poet. For all good poetry is the spontaneous <br />overflow of powerful feelings ; but
            though this be <br />true, Poems to which any value can be attached, <br />were never
            produced on any variety of subjects <br />but by a man who being possessed of more than
            <br />usual organic sensibility had also thought long <br />and deeply. For our
            continued influxes of feeling <br />are modified and directed by our thoughts, which
            <br />are indeed the representatives of all our past feel-<br />ings ; and as by
            contemplating the relation of <br />these general representatives to each other, we
            <br />discover what is really important to men, so by <br />the repetition and
            continuance of this act feelings <br />connected with important subjects will be
            nourish-<br />ed, till at length, if we be originally possessed of <br />much organic
            sensibility, such habits of mind <br />will be produced that by obeying blindly and
            me-<br />chanically the impulses of those habits we shall <br />describe objects and
            utter sentiments of such a <br />nature and in such connection with each other, </p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0019"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xv</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>that the understanding of the being to whom we <br />address ourselves, if he be in a
            healthful state of <br />association, must necessarily be in some degree
            <br />enlightened, his taste exalted, and his affections <br />ameliorated.</p>
         <p>I have said that each of these poems has a <br />purpose. I have also informed my Reader
            what <br />this purpose will be found principally to be: <br />namely to illustrate the
            manner in which our <br />feelings and ideas are associated in a state of
            <br />excitement. But speaking in less general lan-<br />guage, it is to follow the
            fluxes and refluxes of <br />the mind when agitated by the great and simple
            <br />affections of our nature. This object I have endea-<br />voured in these short
            essays to attain by various <br />means ; by tracing the maternal passion through
            <br />many of its more subtle windings, as in the poems <br />of the I<span
               class="small">diot</span> B<span class="small">oy</span> and the M<span class="small"
               >ad</span> M<span class="small">other </span>; by <br />accompanying the last
            struggles of a human being </p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0020"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xvi</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>at the approach of death, cleaving in solitude to <br />life and society, as in the Poem
            of the F<span class="small">orsaken</span><br />I<span class="small">ndian </span>; by
            shewing, as in the Stanzas entitled <br />W<span class="small">e are seven</span>, the
            perplexity and obscurity <br />which in childhood attend our notion of death, <br />or
            rather our utter inability to admit that notion ; <br />or by displaying the strength of
            fraternal, or to <br />speak more philosophically, of moral attachment <br />when early
            associated with the great and beauti-<br />ful objects of nature, as in T<span
               class="small">he</span> B<span class="small">rothers </span>; or, as <br />in the
            Incident of S<span class="small">imon</span> L<span class="small">ee</span>, by placing
            my <br />Reader in the way of receiving from ordinary <br />moral sensations another and
            more salutary im-<br />pression than we are accustomed to receive from <br />them. It
            has also been part of my general pur-<br />pose to attempt to sketch characters under
            the <br />influence of less impassioned feelings, as in the <br />O<span class="small"
               >ld</span> M<span class="small">an travelling</span>, T<span class="small">he
               two</span> T<span class="small">hieves</span>, &amp;c. <br />characters of which the
            elements are simple, be-<br />longing rather to nature than to manners, such </p>

         <br />
         <p>as exist now and will probably always exist, and <br />which from their constitution may
            be distinctly <br />and profitably contemplated. I will not abuse <br />the indulgence
            of my Reader by dwelling longer <br />upon this subject; but it is proper that I should
            <br />mention one other circumstance which distin-<br />guishes these Poems from the
            popular Poetry of <br />the day; it is this, that the feeling therein deve-<br />loped
            gives importance to the action and situation <br />and not the action and situation to
            the feeling. <br />My meaning will be rendered perfectly intelligible <br />by referring
            my Reader to the Poems entitled P<span class="small">oor</span><br />S<span
               class="small">usan</span> and the C<span class="small">hildless</span> F<span
               class="small">ather</span>, particularly <br />to the last Stanza of the latter
            Poem.</p>
         <p>I will not suffer a sense of false modesty to prevent <br />me from asserting, that I
            point my Reader's atten-<br />tion to this mark of distinction far less for the
            <br />sake of these particular Poems than from the <br />general importance of the
            subject. The subject</p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0022"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xviii</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>is indeed important! For the human mind is <br />capable of excitement without the
            application of <br />gross and violent stimulants ; and he must have <br />a very faint
            perception of its beauty and dignity <br />who does not know this, and who does not
            fur-<br />ther know that one being is elevated above <br />another in proportion as he
            possesses this capa-<br />bility. It has therefore appeared to me that to
            <br />endeavour to produce or enlarge this capability is <br />one of the best services
            in which, at any period, <br />a Writer can be engaged ; but this service,
            excel-<br />lent at all times, is especially so at the present day. <br />For a
            multitude of causes unknown to former <br />times are now acting with a combined force
            to <br />blunt the discriminating powers of the mind, and <br />unfitting it for all
            voluntary exertion to reduce it <br />to a state of almost savage torpor. The most
            <br />effective of these causes are the great national <br />events which are daily
            taking place, and the en-<br />creasing accumulation of men in cities, where the</p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0023"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xix</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>uniformity of their occupations produces a craving <br />for extraordinary incident
            which the rapid com-<br />munication of intelligence hourly gratifies. To <br />this
            tendency of life and manners the literature <br />and theatrical exhibitions of the
            country have <br />conformed themselves. The invaluable works of <br />our elder
            writers, I had almost said the works of <br />Shakespear and Milton, are driven into
            neglect <br />by frantic novels, sickly and stupid German Tra-<br />gedies, and deluges
            of idle and extravagant stories <br />in verse.—When I think upon this degrading
            <br />thirst after outrageous stimulation I am almost <br />ashamed to have spoken of
            the feeble effort with <br />which I have endeavoured to counteract it; and
            <br />reflecting upon the magnitude of the general <br />evil, I should be oppressed
            with no dishonorable <br />melancholy, had I not a deep impression of certain
            <br />inherent and indestructible qualities of the human <br />mind, and likewise of
            certain powers in the great <br />and permanent objects that act upon it which are </p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0024"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xx</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>equally inherent and indestructible ; and did I <br />not further add to this impression
            a belief that the <br />time is approaching when the evil will be syste-<br />matically
            opposed by men of greater powers and <br />with far more distinguished success.</p>
         <p>Having dwelt thus long on the subjects and aim <br />of these Poems, I shall request the
            Reader's per-<br />mission to apprize him of a few circumſtances <br />relating to their
               <em>style</em>, in order, among other rea-<br />sons, that I may not be censured for
            not having <br />performed what I never attempted. Except in a <br />very few instances
            the Reader will find no personi-<br />fications of abstract ideas in these volumes, not
            <br />that I mean to censure such personifications : <br />they may be well fitted for
            certain sorts of com-<br />position, but in these Poems I propose to myself <br />to
            imitate, and, as far as is possible, to adopt the <br />very language of men, and I do
            not find that <br />such personifications make any regular or natural</p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0025"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xxi</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>part of that language. I wish to keep my Reader <br />in the company of flesh and blood,
            persuaded that <br />by so doing I shall interest him. Not but that I <br />believe that
            others who pursue a different track <br />may interest him likewise : I do not interfere
            <br />with their claim, I only wish to prefer a different <br />claim of my own. There
            will also be found in <br />these volumes little of what is usually called <br />poetic
            diction ; I have taken as much pains to <br />avoid it as others ordinarily take to
            produce it; <br />this I have done for the reason already alleged, <br />to bring my
            language near to the language of men, <br />and further, because the pleasure which I
            have <br />proposed to myself to impart is of a kind very <br />different from that
            which is supposed by many <br />persons to be the proper object of poetry. I do
            <br />not know how without being culpably particular <br />I can give my Reader a more
            exact notion of the <br />style in which I wished these poems to be writ-<br />ten than
            by informing him that I have at all times</p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0026"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xxii</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>endeavoured to look steadily at my subject, con-<br />sequently I hope it will be found
            that there is in <br />these Poems little falsehood of description, and that <br />my
            ideas are expressed in language fitted to their <br />respective importance. Something I
            must have <br />gained by this practice, as it is friendly to one <br />property of all
            good poetry, namely good sense; <br />but it has necessarily cut me off from a large
            por-<br />tion of phrases and figures of speech which from <br />father to son have long
            been regarded as the <br />common inheritance of Poets. I have also thought <br />it
            expedient to restrict myself still further, having <br />abstained from the use of many
            expressions, in <br />themselves proper and beautiful, but which have <br />been
            foolishly repeated by bad Poets till such <br />feelings of disgust are connected with
            them as it <br />is scarcely possible by any art of association to <br />overpower.</p>
         <p>If in a Poem there should be found a series of lines,</p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0027"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xxiii.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>or even a single line, in which the language, <br />though naturally arranged and
            according to the <br />strict laws of metre, does not differ from that of <br />prose,
            there is a numerous class of critics who, <br />when they stumble upon these prosaisms
            as they <br />call them, imagine that they have made a notable <br />discovery, and
            exult over the Poet as over a man <br />ignorant of his own profession. Now these men
            <br />would establish a canon of criticism which the <br />Reader will conclude he must
            utterly reject if he <br />wishes to be pleased with these volumes. And it <br />would
            be a most easy task to prove to him that <br />not only the language of a large portion
            of every <br />good poem, even of the most elevated character, <br />must necessarily,
            except with reference to the <br />metre, in no respect differ from that of good prose,
            <br />but likewise that some of the most interesting <br />parts of the best poems will
            be found to be <br />strictly the language of prose when prose is well <br />written.
            The truth of this assertion might be</p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0028"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xxiv.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>demonstrated by innumerable passages from almost <br />all the poetical writings, even
            of Milton himself. <br />I have not space for much quotation ; but, to <br />illustrate
            the subject in a general manner, I will <br />here adduce a short composition of Gray,
            who <br />was at the head of those who by their reasonings <br />have attempted to widen
            the space of separation <br />betwixt Prose and Metrical composition, and was <br />more
            than any other man curiously elaborate in <br />the structure of his own poetic
               diction.<br /><span class="blockquote"><span class="l"><span class="ltext">In vain to

         <br />
         <br />
         <p>It will easily by perceived that the only part of <br />this Sonnet which is of any
            value is the lines <br />printed in Italics : it is equally obvious that except <br />in
            the rhyme, and in the use of the single word <br />“fruitless” for fruitlessly, which is
            so far a defect, <br />the language of these lines does in no respect <br />differ from
            that of prose.</p>
         <p>Is there then, it will be asked, no essential dif-<br />ference between the language of
            prose and met-<br />rical composition ? I answer that there neither is <br />nor can be
            any essential difference. We are <br />fond of tracing the resemblance between Poetry
            <br />and Painting, and, accordingly, we call them <br />Sisters : but where shall we
            find bonds of con-<br />nection sufficiently strict to typify the affinity <br />betwixt
            metrical and prose composition ? They <br />both speak by and to the same organs ; the
            bodies <br />in which both of them are clothed may be said to <br />be of the same
            substance, their affections are</p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0030"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xxvi.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>kindred and almost identical, not necessarily <br />differing even in degree; *Poetry
            sheds no tears <br />“such as Angels weep,” but natural and human <br />tears; she can
            boast of no celestial Ichor that <br />distinguishes her vital juices from those of
            prose ; <br />the same human blood circulates through the <br />veins of them both.</p>
         <p>If it be affirmed that rhyme and metrical arrange-<br />ment of themselves constitute a
            distinction which <br />overturns what I have been saying on the strict <br />affinity
            of metrical language with that of prose, <br />and paves the way for other distinctions
               which<span class="footnote">* I here use the word “Poetry” (though against my own
               <br />judgment) as opposed to the word Prose, and synonomous <br />with metrical
               composition. But much confusion has been <br />introduced into criticism by this
               contradistinction of Poetry <br />and Prose, instead of the more philosophical one of
               Poetry <br />and Science. The only strict antithesis to Prose is Metre.</span></p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0031"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xxvii.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>the mind voluntarily admits, I answer that the <br />distinction of rhyme and metre is
            regular and uni-<br />form, and not, like that which is produced by <br />what is
            usually called poetic diction, arbitrary and <br />subject to infinite caprices upon
            which no calcula-<br />tion whatever can be made. In the one case the <br />Reader is
            utterly at the mercy of the Poet re-<br />ſpecting what imagery or diction he may choose
            <br />to connect with the passion, whereas in the other <br />the metre obeys certain
            laws, to which the Poet <br />and Reader both willingly submit because they <br />are
            certain, and because no interference is made <br />by them with the passion but such as
            the con-<br />curring testimony of ages has shewn to heighten <br />and improve the
            pleasure which co-exists with it.</p>
         <p>It will now be proper to answer an obvious ques-<br />tion, namely, why, professing
            these opinions have <br />I written in verse? To this in the first place I <br />reply,
            because, however I may have restricted </p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0032"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xxviii.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>myself, there is still left open to me what con-<br />fessedly constitutes the most
            valuable object of <br />all writing whether in prose or verse, the great <br />and
            universal passions of men, the most general <br />and interesting of their occupations,
            and the entire <br />world of nature, from which I am at liberty to <br />supply myself
            with endless combinations of forms <br />and imagery. Now, granting for a moment that
            <br />whatever is interesting in these objects may be as <br />vividly described in
            prose, why am I to be con-<br />demned if to such description I have endeavoured
            <br />to superadd the charm which by the consent of <br />all nations is acknowledged to
            exist in metrical <br />language ? To this it will be answered, that a <br />very small
            part of the pleasure given by Poetry <br />depends upon the metre, and that it is
            injudicious <br />to write in metre unless it be accompanied with <br />the other
            artificial distinctions of style with which <br />metre is usually accompanied, and that
            by such <br />deviation more will be lost from the shock which </p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0033"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xxix.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>will be thereby given to the Reader's associations <br />than will be counterbalanced by
            any pleasure <br />which he can derive from the general power of <br />numbers. In
            answer to those who thus contend <br />for the necessity of accompanying metre with
            <br />certain appropriate colours of style in order to the <br />accomplishment of its
            appropriate end, and who <br />also, in my opinion, greatly under-rate the power
            <br />of metre in itself, it might perhaps be almost <br />sufficient to observe that
            poems are extant, writ-<br />ten upon more humble subjects, and in a more <br />naked
            and simple style than what I have aimed at, <br />which poems have continued to give
            pleasure <br />from generation to generation. Now, if naked-<br />ness and simplicity be
            a defect, the fact here men-<br />tioned affords a strong presumption that poems
            <br />somewhat less naked and simple are capable of <br />affording pleasure at the
            present day ; and all <br />that I am now attempting is to justify myself for
            <br />having written under the impression of this <br />belief.</p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0034"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xxx.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>But I might point out various causes why, when <br />the style is manly, and the subject
            of some im-<br />portance, words metrically arranged will long con-<br />tinue to impart
            such a pleasure to mankind as he <br />who is sensible of the extent of that pleasure
            will <br />be desirous to impart. The end of Poetry is to <br />produce excitement in
            coexistence with an over-<br />balance of pleasure. Now, by the supposition,
            <br />excitement is an unusual and irregular state of <br />the mind; ideas and feelings
            do not in that state <br />succeed each other in accustomed order. But if <br />the
            words by which this excitement is produced <br />are in themselves powerful, or the
            images and <br />feelings have an undue proportion of pain con-<br />nected with them,
            there is some danger that the <br />excitement may be carried beyond its proper
            <br />bounds. Now the co-presence of something <br />regular, something to which the
            mind has been <br />accustomed when in an unexcited or a less excited <br />state,
            cannot but have great efficacy in tempering</p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0035"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xxxi.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>and restraining the passion by an intertexture of <br />ordinary feeling. This may be
            illustrated by appeal-<br />ing to the Reader's own experience of the reluctance
            <br />with which he comes to the re-perusal of the dis-<br />tressful parts of Clarissa
            Harlowe, or the Gamester. <br />While Shakespeare's writings, in the most pathetic
            <br />scenes, never act upon us as pathetic beyond the <br />bounds of pleasure—an
            effect which is in a great de-<br />gree to be ascribed to small, but continual and
            regu-<br />lar impulses of pleasurable surprise from the metrical <br />arrangement.—On
            the other hand (what it must <br />be allowed will much more frequently happen) <br />if
            the Poet's words should be incommensurate <br />with the passion, and inadequate to
            raise the <br />Reader to a height of desirable excitement, then, <br />(unless the
            Poet's choice of his metre has been <br />grossly injudicious) in the feelings of
            pleasure <br />which the Reader has been accustomed to con-<br />nect with metre in
            general, and in the feeling, <br />whether chearful or melancholy, which he has </p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0036"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xxxii.</span>
         <br />

         <p>been accustomed to connect with that particular <br />movement of metre, there will be
            found some-<br />thing which will greatly contribute to impart <br />passion to the
            words, and to effect the complex <br />end which the Poet proposes to himself.</p>
         <p>If I had undertaken a systematic defence of the <br />theory upon which these poems are
            written, it <br />would have been my duty to develope the various <br />causes upon
            which the pleasure received from <br />metrical language depends. Among the chief of
            <br />these causes is to be reckoned a principle which <br />must be well known to those
            who have made any <br />of the Arts the object of accurate reflection ; I <br />mean the
            pleasure which the mind derives from <br />the perception of similitude in
            dissimilitude. This <br />principle is the great spring of the activity of our
            <br />minds and their chief feeder. From this princi-<br />ple the direction of the
            sexual appetite, and all <br />the passions connected with it take their origin :</p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0037"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xxxiii.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>It is the life of our ordinary conversation ; and <br />upon the accuracy with which
            similitude in <br />dissimilitude, and dissimilitude in similitude are <br />perceived,
            depend our taste and our moral feel-<br />ings. It would not have been a useless
            employ-<br />ment to have applied this principle to the con-<br />sideration of metre,
            and to have shewn that metre <br />is hence enabled to afford much pleasure, and
            <br />to have pointed out in what manner that pleasure <br />is produced. But my limits
            will not permit me to <br />enter upon this subject, and I must content my-<br />self
            with a general summary.</p>
         <p>I have said that Poetry is the spontaneous overflow <br />of powerful feelings : it
            takes its origin from emo-<br />tion recollected in tranquillity : the emotion is
            <br />contemplated till by a species of reaction the <br />tranquillity gradually
            disappears, and an emotion, <br />similar to that which was before the subject of
            <br />contemplation, is gradually produced, and does </p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0038"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xxxiv.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>itself actually exist in the mind. In this mood <br />successful composition generally
            begins, and in a <br />mood similar to this it is carried on ; but the <br />emotion, of
            whatever kind and in whatever de-<br />gree, from various causes is qualified by various
            <br />pleasures, so that in describing any passions what-<br />soever, which are
            voluntarily described, the mind <br />will upon the whole be in a state of enjoyment.
            <br />Now if Nature be thus cautious in preserving in <br />a state of enjoyment a being
            thus employed, <br />the Poet ought to profit by the lesson thus held <br />forth to
            him, and ought especially to take care, <br />that whatever passions he communicates to
            his <br />Reader, those passions, if his Reader's mind be <br />sound and vigorous,
            should always be accompa-<br />nied with an overbalance of pleasure. Now the <br />music
            of harmonious metrical language, the sense <br />of difficulty overcome, and the blind
            association of <br />pleasure which has been previously received from <br />works of
            rhyme or metre of the same or similar </p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0039"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xxxv.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>construction, all these imperceptibly make up a <br />complex feeling of delight, which
            is of the most <br />important use in tempering the painful feeling <br />which will
            always be found intermingled with <br />powerful descriptions of the deeper passions.
            <br />This effect is always produced in pathetic and <br />impassioned poetry ; while in
            lighter composi-<br />tions the ease and gracefulness with which the <br />Poet manages
            his numbers are themselves con-<br />fessedly a principal source of the gratification of
            <br />the Reader. I might perhaps include all which <br />it is <em>necessary</em> to
            say upon this subject by affirming <br />what few persons will deny, that of two
            descrip-<br />tions either of passions, manners, or characters, <br />each of them
            equally well executed, the one in <br />prose and the other in verse, the verse will be
            <br />read a hundred times where the prose is read <br />once. We see that Pope by the
            power of verse <br />alone, has contrived to render the plainest com-<br />mon sense
            interesting, and even frequently to </p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0040"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xxxvi.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>invest it with the appearance of passion. In con-<br />sequence of these convictions I
            related in metre <br />the Tale of G<span class="small">oody</span> B<span class="small"
               >lake</span> and H<span class="small">arry</span> G<span class="small">ill</span>,
            <br />which is one of the rudest of this collection. I <br />wished to draw attention to
            the truth that the <br />power of the human imagination is sufficient to <br />produce
            such changes even in our physical nature <br />as might almost appear miraculous. The
            truth is <br />an important one; the fact (for it is a <em>fact</em>) is a
            <br />valuable illustration of it. And I have the satis-<br />faction of knowing that it
            has been communicated <br />to many hundreds of people who would never <br />have heard
            of it, had it not been narrated as a <br />Ballad, and in a more impressive metre than
            is <br />usual in Ballads.</p>
         <p>Having thus adverted to a few of the reasons why <br />I have written in verse, and why
            I have chosen <br />subjects from common life, and endeavoured to <br />bring my
            language near to the real language of </p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0041"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xxxvii.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>men, if I have been too minute in pleading my <br />own cause, I have at the same time
            been treat-<br />ing a subject of general interest ; and it is for this <br />reason
            that I request the Reader's permission to <br />add a few words with reference solely to
            these <br />particular poems, and to some defects which will <br />probably be found in
            them. I am sensible that <br />my associations must have sometimes been
            par-<br />ticular instead of general, and that, consequently, <br />giving to things a
            false importance, sometimes <br />from diseased impulses I may have written upon
            <br />unworthy subjects; but I am less apprehensive <br />on this account, than that my
            language may fre-<br />quently have suffered from those arbitrary con-<br />nections of
            feelings and ideas with particular <br />words, from which no man can altogether protect
            <br />himself. Hence I have no doubt that in some <br />instances feelings even of the
            ludicrous may be <br />given to my Readers by expressions which ap-<br />peared to me
            tender and pathetic. Such faulty </p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0042"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xxxviii.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>expressions, were I convinced they were faulty <br />at present, and that they must
            necessarily con-<br />tinue to be so, I would willingly take all rea-<br />sonable pains
            to correct. But it is dangerous to <br />make these alterations on the simple authority
            of <br />a few individuals, or even of certain classes of <br />men ; for where the
            understanding of an Author <br />is not convinced, or his feelings altered, this
            <br />cannot be done without great injury to himself : <br />for his own feelings are
            his stay and support, and <br />if he sets them aside in one instance, he may be
            <br />induced to repeat this act till his mind loses all <br />confidence in itself and
            becomes utterly debilitated.<br />To this it may be added, that the Reader ought
            <br />never to forget that he is himself exposed to the <br />same errors as the Poet,
            and perhaps in a much <br />greater degree : for there can be no presumption <br />in
            saying that it is not probable he will be so well <br />acquainted with the various
            stages of meaning <br />through which words have passed, or with the </p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0043"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xxxix.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>fickleness or stability of the relations of particular <br />ideas to each other ; and
            above all, since he is <br />so much less interested in the subject, he may <br />decide
            lightly and carelessly.</p>
         <p>Long as I have detained my Reader, I hope he <br />will permit me to caution him against
            a mode of <br />false criticism which has been applied to Poetry <br />in which the
            language closely resembles that of <br />life and nature. Such verses have been
            triumphed <br />over in parodies of which Dr. Johnson's Stanza is <br />a fair
               specimen.<br /><span class="blockquote"><span class="l"><span class="ltext">“ I put
                     my hat upon my head,</span></span><span class="l"><span class="ltext">And
                     walk'd into the Strand,</span></span><span class="l"><span class="ltext">And
                     there I met another man</span></span><span class="l"><span class="ltext">Whose
                     hat was in his hand.”</span></span></span><br /><br />Immediately under these
            lines I will place one <br />of the most justly admired stanzas of the “
            <em>Babes</em><br />in the Wood.”</p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0044"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xl.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p><span class="blockquote"><span class="l"><span class="ltext">“ These pretty Babes with
                     hand in hand</span></span><span class="l"><span class="ltext">Went wandering up
                     and down ;</span></span><span class="l"><span class="ltext">But never more they
                     saw the Man</span></span><span class="l"><span class="ltext">Approaching from
                     the Town.”</span></span></span><br /><br />In both of these stanzas the words,
            and the order <br />of the words, in no respect differ from the most <br />unimpassioned
            conversation. There are words in <br />both, for example, “the Strand,” and “the Town,”
            <br />connected with none but the most familiar ideas ; <br />yet the one stanza we
            admit as admirable, and <br />the other as a fair example of the superlatively
            <br />contemptible. Whence arises this difference? <br />Not from the metre, not from
            the language, not <br />from the order of the words; but the
            <em>matter</em><br />expressed in Dr. Johnson's stanza is contemptible. <br />The proper
            method of treating trivial and simple <br />verses to which Dr. Johnson's stanza would
            be a <br />fair parallelism is not to say this is a bad kind of <br />poetry, or this is
            not poetry, but this wants sense ; <br />it is neither interesting in itself, nor can
               <em>lead</em> to</p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0045"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xli.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>any thing interesting; the images neither origi-<br />nate in that sane state of feeling
            which arises out <br />of thought, nor can excite thought or feeling in <br />the
            Reader. This is the only sensible manner of <br />dealing with such verses : Why trouble
            yourself <br />about the species till you have previously decided <br />upon the genus ?
            Why take pains to prove that <br />an Ape is not a Newton when it is self-evident
            <br />that he is not a man.</p>
         <p>I have one request to make of my Reader, which <br />is, that in judging these Poems he
            would decide <br />by his own feelings genuinely, and not by reflec-<br />tion upon what
            will probably be the judgment of <br />others. How common is it to hear a person say,
            <br />“ I myself do not object to this style of composi-<br />tion or this or that
            expression, but to such and <br />such classes of people it will appear mean or
            <br />ludicrous.” This mode of criticism so destructive <br />of all sound unadulterated
            judgment is almost</p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0046"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xlii.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>universal: I have therefore to request that the <br />Reader would abide independently
            by his own <br />feelings, and that if he finds himself affected he <br />would not
            suffer such conjectures to interfere <br />with his pleasure.</p>
         <p>If an Author by any single composition has im-<br />pressed us with respect for his
            talents, it is useful <br />to consider this as affording a presumption, that, <br />on
            other occasions where we have been displeased, <br />he nevertheless may not have
            written ill or ab-<br />surdly ; and, further, to give him so much credit <br />for this
            one composition as may induce us to <br />review what has displeased us with more care
            <br />than we should otherwise have bestowed upon it. <br />This is not only an act of
            justice, but in our deci-<br />sions upon poetry especially, may conduce in a <br />high
            degree to the improvement of our own taste : <br />for an <em>accurate</em> taste in
            Poetry and in all the other <br />arts, as Sir Joshua Reynolds has observed, is an </p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0047"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xliii.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p><em>acquired</em> talent, which can only be produced by <br />thought and a long
            continued intercourse with <br />the best models of composition. This is
            men-<br />tioned not with so ridiculous a purpose as to pre-<br />vent the most
            inexperienced Reader from judging <br />for himself, (I have already said that I wish
            him <br />to judge for himself ;) but merely to temper the <br />rashness of decision,
            and to suggest that if <br />Poetry be a subject on which much time has <br />not been
            bestowed, the judgment may be <br />erroneous, and that in many cases it necessarily
            <br />will be so.</p>
         <p>I know that nothing would have so effectually <br />contributed to further the end which
            I have in <br />view as to have shewn of what kind the pleasure <br />is, and how the
            pleasure is produced which is <br />confessedly produced by metrical composition
            <br />essentially different from what I have here en-<br />deavoured to recommend; for
            the Reader will </p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0048"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xliv.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>say that he has been pleased by such composition <br />and what can I do more for him?
            The power of <br />any art is limited and he will suspect that if I pro-<br />pose to
            furnish him with new friends it is only <br />upon condition of his abandoning his old
            friends. <br />Besides, as I have said, the Reader is himself <br />conscious of the
            pleasure which he has received <br />from such composition, composition to which he
            <br />has peculiarly attached the endearing name of <br />Poetry ; and all men feel an
            habitual gratitude, <br />and something of an honorable bigotry for the <br />objects
            which have long continued to please them: <br />we not only wish to be pleased, but to
            be pleased <br />in that particular way in which we have been <br />accustomed to be
            pleased. There is a host of <br />arguments in these feelings ; and I should be the
            <br />less able to combat them successfully, as I am <br />willing to allow, that, in
            order entirely to enjoy <br />the Poetry which I am recommending, it would <br />be
            necessary to give up much of what is ordinarily</p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0049"></span>
         <span class="pageTopCenter">xlv.</span>
         <br />
         <br />
         <p>enjoyed. But would my limits have permitted <br />me to point out how this pleasure is
            produced, I <br />might have removed many obstacles, and assisted <br />my Reader in
            perceiving that the powers of lan-<br />guage are not so limited as he may suppose ; and
            <br />that it is possible that poetry may give other <br />enjoyments, of a purer, more
            lasting, and more <br />exquisite nature. But this part of my subject I <br />have been
            obliged altogether to omit : as it has <br />been less my present aim to prove that the
            interest <br />excited by some other kinds of poetry is less <br />vivid, and less
            worthy of the nobler powers of the <br />mind, than to offer reasons for presuming,
            that, <br />if the object which I have proposed to myself <br />were adequately
            attained, a species of poetry <br />would be produced, which is genuine poetry ;
            <br />in its nature well adapted to interest man-<br />kind permanently, and likewise
            important in <br />the multiplicity and quality of its moral rela-<br />tions.</p>
         <span class="newPage" id="0050"></span>

         <br />
         <br />
         <p>From what has been said, and from a perusal of <br />the Poems, the Reader will be able
            clearly to <br />perceive the object which I have proposed to <br />myself : he will
            determine how far I have attained <br />this object; and, what is a much more important
            <br />question, whether it be worth attaining; and <br />upon the decision of these two
            questions will rest <br />my claim to the approbation of the public.</p>

         <span class="footnote">* “<em> Most musical, most melancholy.</em>” This passage in Milton
            <br />possesses an excellence far superior to that of mere description : <br />it is
            spoken in the character of the melancholy Man, and has <br />therefore a
               <em>dramatic</em> propriety. The Author makes this remark, <br />to rescue himself
            from the charge of having alluded with levity <br />to a line in Milton: a charge than
            which none could be more <br />painful to him, except perhaps that of having ridiculed
            his <br />Bible.</span>

               Poem ought to have <br />been preceded by an introductory Poem, which I have
               <br />been prevented from writing by never having felt myself <br />in a mood when it
               was probable that I should write it well.<br /> —The character which I have here
               introduced speaking <br />is sufficiently common. The Reader will perhaps have
               <br />a general notion of it, if he has ever known a man, a Cap-<br />tain of a small
               trading vessel for example, who being past <br />the middle age of life, had retired
               upon an annuity or <br />small independent income to some village or country town
               <br />of which he was not a native, or in which he had not been <br />accustomed to
               live. Such men having little to do become <br />credulous and talkative from
               indolence ; and from the <br />same cause, and other predisposing causes by which it
               is <br />probable that such men may have been affected, they <br />are prone to
               superstition. On which account it appeared <br />to me proper to select a character
               like this to exhibit some <br />of the general laws by which superstition acts upon
               the <br />mind. Superstitious men are almost always men of slow <br />faculties and
               deep feelings; their minds are not loose but <br />adhesive ; they have a reasonable
               share of imagination, by <br />which word I mean the faculty which produces
               impressive <span class="newPage" id="0264"></span><span class="runHead"
               >NOTES.</span><br /><br />effects out of simple elements ; but they are utterly
               desti-<br />tute of fancy, the power by which pleasure and surprize <br />are excited
               by sudden varieties of situation and by accumu-<br />lated imagery.</p>
            <p class="note">It was my wish in this poem to shew the manner in which <br />such men
               cleave to the same ideas ; and to follow the turns <br />of passion, always
               different, yet not palpably different, by <br />which their conversation is swayed. I
               had two objects to <br />attain ; first, to represent a picture which should not be
               <br />unimpressive yet consistent with the character that should <br />describe it,
               secondly, while I adhered to the style in which <br />such persons describe, to take
               care that words, which in <br />their minds are impregnated with passion, should
               likewise <br />convey passion to Readers who are not accustomed to <br />sympathize
               with men feeling in that manner or using such <br />language. It seemed to me that
               this might be done by <br />calling in the assistance of Lyrical and rapid Metre. It
               <br />was necessary that the Poem, to be natural, should in <br />reality move slowly
               ; yet I hoped, that, by the aid of the <br />metre, to those who should at all enter
               into the spirit of the <br />Poem, it would appear to move quickly. The Reader will
               <br />have the kindness to excuse this note as I am sensible that <br />an
               introductory Poem is necessary to give this Poem its <br />full effect.</p>
            <p class="note">Upon this occasion I will request permission to add a few <br />words
               closely connected with T<span class="small">he </span>T<span class="small">horn
               </span>and many other<span class="newPage" id="0265"></span><span class="runHead"
                  >NOTES.</span><br /><br />Poems in these Volumes. There is a numerous class of
               <br />readers who imagine that the same words cannot be repeated <br />without
               tautology : this is a great error : virtual tautology <br />is much oftener produced
               by using different words when <br />the meaning is exactly the same. Words, a Poet's
               words <br />more particularly, ought to be weighed in the balance of <br />feeling
               and not measured by the space which they occupy <br />upon paper. For the Reader
               cannot be too often re-<br />minded that Poetry is passion : it is the history or
               science <br />of feelings : now every man must know that an attempt is <br />rarely
               made to communicate impassioned feelings without <br />something of an accompanying
               consciousness of the inade-<br />quateness of our own powers, or the deficiencies of
               lan-<br />guage. During such efforts there will be a craving in the <br />mind, and
               as long as it is unsatisfied the Speaker will cling <br />to the same words, or words
               of the same character. There <br />are also various other reasons why repetition and
               apparent <br />tautology are frequently beauties of the highest kind. Among <br />the
               chief of these reasons is the interest which the mind at-<br />taches to words, not
               only as symbols of the passion, but <br />as <em>things</em>, active and efficient,
               which are of themselves <br />part of the passion. And further, from a spirit of
               fond-<br />ness, exultation, and gratitude, the mind luxuriates in <br />the
               repetition of words which appear successfully to com-<br />municate its feelings. The
               truth of these remarks might <br />be shewn by innumerable passages from the Bible
               and <br />from the impassioned poetry of every nation.</p>

               155.</span>—I cannot refuse <br />myself the gratification of informing such Readers
               as may <br />have been pleased with this Poem, or with any part of it, that
               <br />they owe their pleasure in some sort to me ; as the Author <br />was himself
               very desirous that it should be suppressed. <br />This wish had arisen from a
               consciousness of the defects <br />of the Poem, and from a knowledge that many
               persons had <br />been much displeased with it. The Poem of my Friend <br />has
               indeed great defects ; first, that the principal person <br />has no distinct
               character, either in his profession of Mari-<br />ner, or as a human being who having
               been long under the <br />controul of supernatural impressions might be supposed
               <br />himself to partake of something supernatural : secondly, <br />that he does not
               act, but is continually acted upon : thirdly, <br />that the events having no
               necessary connection do not <br />produce each other ; and lastly, that the imagery
               is some-<br />what too laboriously accumulated. Yet the Poem contains <br />many
               delicate touches of passion, and indeed the passion<span class="newPage" id="0267"
                  ></span><span class="runHead">NOTES.</span><br /><br />is every where true to
               nature ; a great number of the stan-<br />zas present beautiful images, and are
               expressed with unu-<br />sual felicity of language ; and the versification, though
               the <br />metre is itself unfit for long poems, is harmonious and <br />artfully
               varied, exhibiting the utmost powers of that metre, <br />and every variety of which
               it is capable. It therefore <br />appeared to me that these several merits (the first
               of which, <br />namely that of the passion, is of the highest kind,) gave to
               <br />the Poem a value which is not often possessed by better <br />Poems. On this
               account I requested of my Friend to per-<br />mit me to republish it.</p>

               <br />written with a hope that in the transitions, and the im-<br />passioned music
               of the versification would be found the <br />principal requisites of that species of
               composition.</p>
